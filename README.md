# AquaSoil
This project combines silica and perlite to create an "intelligent substrate" that maximizes water retention and prevents waste. Integrated with nutrient-rich black soil, it ensures a constant supply of moisture and minerals. As water is released, plants absorb vital residues, promoting species survival and achieving significant water savings.
